# Lab 04 Report - Open Source Licensing
## 1) Give a Creative Commons license to your lab report
  Link to license [here](./LICENSE).
## 2) Read the four criteria for Free Software
  Done
## 3) Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
  Having a license on your code or any portion of your work tells others how you wish your work be used. Other people cannot contribute to your project if it is not licensed, as they cannot be sure whether they are allowed to contribute, or whether the contributions they make will be used in the future. Further, adding a lisence to your code allows for commercial applicability, since corporations cannot use products they do not own or have permission to use. Wider adoption improves code quality, features, security and testing, thus having a license is imperative to maintaining a sucessfully open source project.
## 4) Why you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
  When someone works on a project, they have exclusive copyright to that work, so you can't use, edit or distribute thier work without potentially running into legal issues. Even if the owner expects outside contribution, if there is no license, they own 100% of the work and if you work on their project, you own an exclusive copyright to their work. Thus, you won't be allowed to use your own code that you wrote, so you should always make sure to verify a license
## 5) Do you agree with this claim?
  I do agree with the authors claim that the Web beat Gopher, with an emphasis on thier failure to adhere to the open systems model. For software to thrive, it must become decentralized, the quicker the better, or risk losing to one which is. The World Wide Web rise to dominance not because they were first, but because Gopher took it upon themselves to decide "what is right" and not the users who actually use the software. The number of users will always end up more than the number of developers, so software that is licensed harshly will likely lose
## 6) Why does Linux use GPLv2?
  Linux has a history intertwined closely with the history of Open Source development as a whole. It's main developer, Linus Torvalds, initially was using a license of his own creation that allowed for complete openness and **no** monetezation whatsoever. What changed his mind is that he was approached to offer his software for sale so he switched to a GPLv2 license to allow for the opportunity but not necessity to profit from his creation [According to this source](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2016/08/23/linus-torvalds-early-linux-history-gpl-license-money). While Linus did not have as many  resources as other already established projects, what drove developers to work on Linux was his commitment to decentrilization and outsider contribution. By creating a culture of development, and not profit, Linus was able to establish Linux as one of the biggest market leaders. This is why Linux uses GPLv2, no harbor very open development with the **option** to make money if necessary
