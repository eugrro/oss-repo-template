1. The ten criteria for open source are very important to set a standard for open source so that everyone knows what they are contributing to and what they can do with the open source code. These rules outline the rules that everyone must follow when working on and using open source material so that there are no surprises when the code is altered, modified, changed, updated or otherwise used by another individual or party
2. I think two more things that can be added to how to answer a question in a helpful way are:
    1. Provide supporting evidence and additional information when needed. Linking to other websites or tutorials can be extrememly helpful to the other person since this both validates your response and provides more assistance to the question asker if there is any doubt left over after your response
    2. In many forums (such as StackOverflow) upvoting and downvoting other responses are just as valuable as creating your response since you validate the correct answers which improves confidence of other users when they run into a similar issue

I made the guy follow the maze by following the left wall. If there was a left turn, then he turns left. If not, he checks if he can go forward and does if he can. If he cant go left or go forward, he turns right as it is his only choice

1. An interesting open source open library to evaludate would be the [flutter](https://github.com/eugrro/oss-repo-template/blob/master/index.md) repository
3. I have contributed a little bit to this open source project through bug reports and creating issues. I have also contacted other flutter devs on how to best fix issues I have brought up and some (a couple lines) of my code has since shipped with a recent update of flutter
4. This is a very cool list. As a user of audacity, I knew audacity was free, but I didn't know it was open source and it was interesting to learn the history of the application and how it became a mainstream audio editing program
