I made the guy follow the maze by following the left wall. If there was a left turn, then he turns left. If not, he checks if he can go forward and does if he can. If he cant go left or go forward, he turns right as it is his only choice

1. An interesting open source open library to evaludate would be the [flutter](https://github.com/eugrro/oss-repo-template/blob/master/index.md) repository
3. I have contributed a little bit to this open source project through bug reports and creating issues. I have also contacted other flutter devs on how to best fix issues I have brought up and some (a couple lines) of my code has since shipped with a recent update of flutter
4. This is a very cool list. As a user of audacity, I knew audacity was free, but I didn't know it was open source and it was interesting to learn the history of the application and how it became a mainstream audio editing program
