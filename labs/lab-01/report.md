1. The ten criteria for open source are very important to set a standard for open source so that everyone knows what they are contributing to and what they can do with the open source code. These rules outline the rules that everyone must follow when working on and using open source material so that there are no surprises when the code is altered, modified, changed, updated or otherwise used by another individual or party
3. I think two more things that can be added to how to answer a question in a helpful way are:
    1. Provide supporting evidence and additional information when needed. Linking to other websites or tutorials can be extrememly helpful to the other person since this both validates your response and provides more assistance to the question asker if there is any doubt left over after your response
    2. In many forums (such as StackOverflow) upvoting and downvoting other responses are just as valuable as creating your response since you validate the correct answers which improves confidence of other users when they run into a similar issue 
4. This was a very interesting read as a student of RPI. From Jesse's point of view he had done nothing wrong but was stuck with an impossible dilemma. While it is clear to see how the RIAA has the right to claim copyright infringement, I don't believe they had the moral right to do so. As a country and a tech landscape built on continual innovation and improvement, it is very sad to see how a larger and more powerful entity squashes the spirit of innovation. Jesse was improving lives, without pay, simply for the pleasure of learning and evolving the technology. If large corporations set $15,000,000 fines for students tinkering, this will set a bad precedent for future tinkerers. Another consideration is that RPI should have stepped in somewhere and provided both legal and monetary protection for its students. Why was Jesse forced to use his Uncle as his legal representative and why would be have been forced to pay the $12,000 out of his pocket. As a technical university with many more resources than a student, they should have provided legal council, and payed for him as this was done in the benefit of the RPI student body. It is very unfortunate that Jesse was left to his own devices while large corporations went after him and large institutions were not providing any support.

I made the guy follow the maze by following the left wall. If there was a left turn, then he turns left. If not, he checks if he can go forward and does if he can. If he cant go left or go forward, he turns right as it is his only choice

1. An interesting open source open library to evaludate would be the [flutter](https://github.com/eugrro/oss-repo-template/blob/master/index.md) repository
3. I have contributed a little bit to this open source project through bug reports and creating issues. I have also contacted other flutter devs on how to best fix issues I have brought up and some (a couple lines) of my code has since shipped with a recent update of flutter
4. This is a very cool list. As a user of audacity, I knew audacity was free, but I didn't know it was open source and it was interesting to learn the history of the application and how it became a mainstream audio editing program
